## Features

- **AI Collaboration**: Multiple AI agents with specialized roles work together to accomplish tasks.
- **Customizable Workflows**: Define tasks and agent roles via configuration files.
- **Markdown Blog Post Generation**: Automatically generate well-structured blog posts for any given topic.
- **Streamlined Setup**: Simplified dependency management using [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.12 installed.
- **UV**: This project uses UV for dependency management.

Install UV if you havenâ€™t already:

```bash
pip install uv
```

### Setup

Sync the project dependencies by running:

```bash
uv sync
```

---

## Environment Setup

Configure your environment for seamless execution by adding the necessary environment variables to a `.env` file. For detailed guidance on setting up your LLM (Large Language Model) configuration, refer to the [crewAI documentation](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/llms).

Example `.env` file:

```plaintext
LLM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
MODEL_TYPE=your_model_type_here
```

---

## Usage

To start the project and generate a blog post for your chosen topic, execute the following command in the root directory:

```bash
make run topic="<Your topic here>"
```

### Example

```bash
make run topic="The future of AI in healthcare"
```

This will initialize the ResearchCrew Crew, assemble AI agents, and produce a Markdown file containing a blog post about your specified topic.

---

## Configuration

The project relies on two main configuration files:

1. **`config/tasks.yaml`**: Defines the tasks and their workflows for the AI agents.
2. **`config/agents.yaml`**: Outlines the roles, goals, and tools available to each AI agent.

Feel free to customize these files to adapt the behavior of the AI agents to your needs.
